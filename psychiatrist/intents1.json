            "Mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.",
            "Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.",
            "Maintaining mental health is crucial to stabilizing constructive behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Focusing on mental health care can increase productivity, enhance our self-image, and improve relationships.",
            "A mental health disorder is characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life.",
            "For a diagnosis of depression, a person needs to have experienced low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in life for at least 2 weeks. They may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or irritability nearly every day.",
            "Therapy is a form of treatment that aims to help resolve mental or emotional issues. It is helpful for those with mental health conditions or even everyday life challenges.",
            "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.",
            "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.",
            "Symptoms of mental health disorders vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Examples include sadness, hopelessness, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.",
            "Early identification and treatment are of vital importance. With the proper treatment, many individuals experience a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life.",
            "Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy, or a combination of the two. Treatments should be discussed with a professional.",
            "Self-care involves taking actions to maintain and improve physical and mental well-being. This includes practices like exercise, sleep, and relaxation techniques.",
            "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Both can negatively impact your mental health and daily life.",
            "Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression or major depressive disorder."
